Research Topic
Meghana Gantla, Hang Wang, Adarsh Kotla

The research topic we chose for our group is to study song data from Spotify. 
We have around 18000 observations and 15 variables in the dataset including the popularity, duration, energy, and danceability of each song. 

SMART Question: 
What factors affect the popularity of a song?
We will pre-process the data for duplicates and then split it into two parts for training and testing. 
We want to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as most of the variables are continuous. 
The complexity here arises from strong multicollinearity between variables. After the analysis, 
we will use our findings to predict the popularity of a song based on its energy, loudness, acoustics, liveness, etc.
